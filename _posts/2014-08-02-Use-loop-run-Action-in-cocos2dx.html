<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
<p>
	If you want to use loop run many actions and clean them up in the
	last loop, or you want to call a function at the end in cocos2dx,
	you can try the code, instead of closure for the reason that the
	closure will make your code more complex.
	<pre class = "javascript">
		var action = xxx;
		var sprite = xxx;

		for (var i = 0; i < n; i++)
		{
			if (i == n - 1)
			{
			}
			else
			{
			}
		}
	</pre>
</p>

<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
<p>This is my first article, I want to introduce how to build a blog by git.</p>
<p>
	1. You can see <a href="https://pages.github.com">pages.github.com<a> and you will get
	a blog repository.
</p>
<p>
	2. You can see the blog write by 阮一峰 and what I want to say is you need not to
	create a new branch, you can just use the master branch.
</p>
<p>
	3. The last but not least is you may need to learn jekyll's syntax, you mustn't name
	a folder or a file at will.
</p>
